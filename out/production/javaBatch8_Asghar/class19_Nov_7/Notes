Complier converts your java code to the byte code where in ehich our JVM can understand.

CONSTRUCTORS:
it is a special block of code  used to create an object.
■It is a special block of code similarto method that is executed when we create an object.
■ the purpose of the costructors is to initialize our fields.
■ A constructor must have the same name as the class itself.
■ Constructors do not have a return type—not even void .
■ Constructors are invoked using the new operator when an object is created.
Constructors play the role of initializing objects.
■ We pass arguements to constructors


SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES BETWEEN CONSTRUCTORS:

1- both have parameters
2- both have access modifiers like private/ public/ protected / default.

Differences:
1- Constructor name must be same with the class name.
2- constructors cannot return values as methods can
3- constructors cannot use static final abstract
4- constructors are automatically called when an instance of the class is created.

When should we use constructors?
- when we want to control the initialization for our fields.

JAVA WILL NOT CREATE DEFAULT CONSTRUCTOR IF YOU CREATE YOUR OWN CONSTRUCTORS
