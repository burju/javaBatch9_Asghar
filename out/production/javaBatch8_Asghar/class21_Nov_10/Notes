INHERITANCE:

inheritance is a mechanishm in java.
through which we can se the fields and methods from one class to another class without re-writing
a single line of code / repeting the code.

BENEFITS:
1-cleaner more efficient code for memory and execution
2- it helpds use reduce dublicate code
3- save time
4- reusing same code again&again

disadvantages:
classes are tightly coupled in parent class affect child classs

Class Parent{
int Money;
void print(){
south"Money"
}
}
WHAT CANNOT BE INHERITED?
-see slides

WE can access our static fields and methods using class names& using objects
of the class. But using class name is prefferable.
Because static methods and fields belongs to class not to objects.


SUPER KEYWORD:
as we can use this keyword in java to refer to the current fields and methods we can use super keyword
to access the fields adn methods from immidiate parent class.
it is used in subclasses
