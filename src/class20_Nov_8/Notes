THIS KEYWORD:

we can use THIS keyword to call our constructors as well.
this can be used with variables, methods, constructors.


INHERITANCE:
disadvantages:
    * the two classes(parent& child) are tightly coupled.
    *
    3 TYPES OF INHERITANCE:
    - Single inheritance A-->B (B inherits from A)
    - Multilevel inheritance A--> B-->C-->D ( D inherits the properties of C,B,A)
    - Hierarchical inheritance A-->b , A-->c, A-->d ( A inherits b, A inherits c, A inherits d sperately)no

 Why Java doesnt let inherit from multiple clases?
 to reduce complexity, and simplify language multiple inheritance is not supported.
 compile time errors are better than runtime errors.

 WHAT IS NOT POSSIBLE WITH INHERITANCE?
 1- private members of the superclass are not inherited by the subclass. we'll get complier time error if we try.

 2- members that have default accessibility in the superclass are also not inherited by subclass in other packages, as these emmebrs are only accessible by their simple names in subclass within
